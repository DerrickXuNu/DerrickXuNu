### Hi there, I'm [Runsheng Xu(徐润生 in Chinese)!](https://derrickxunu.github.io/) 👋

I am a Research Scientist at [Waymo](https://waymo.com), working on the most exciting research projects in Autonomous Driving. I gained my PhD degree from UCLA in 2.5 years, with publications in CVPR/ECCV/ICCV/TPAMI/CoRL/ICRA.
I was also a senior deep learning engineer at [Mercedes-Benz R&D North America(MBRDNA)](https://mbrdna.com/) and 
a computer vision engineer at [OPPO R&D US](https://www.oppo.com/en/) from 2018-2020.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **Autonomous Driving** topics related to **Perception**, **Simulation**, and **Cooperative Driving Automation**
- **Generative AI** topics related to **LLM**, **Diffusion**, and **World Model**.
- **Computer Vision** topics related to **Vision Transformer**.
